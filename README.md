CSS Units
=========

Explainers for several kinds of units proposed for inclusion in CSS (and SCSS and LESS)

- [anthropometric units](explainers/human.md) related to the human body and mind, which may adapt to the user to improve acessibility, e.g. `tip`
- [real physical length units](explainer/physical.md) that do not depend on the display environment (and are never anchored on `px`)
- traditional or local [typographic length units](explainer/traditional.md) like the Didot point
- [adaptive length units](explainer/font.md) relating to the measures of the actual font used (like `em`  etc.), e.g. upstroke thickness
