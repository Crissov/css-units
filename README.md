CSS Units
=========

Explainers for several kinds of units proposed for inclusion in CSS (and SCSS and LESS)

- real physical length units that do not depend on the display environment (and are never anchored on `px`)
- anthropometric units related to the human body and mind, which may adapt to the user, e.g. `tip`
- traditional or local typographic units like the Didot point
- units relating to the measures of the actual font used, e.g. upstroke thickness
